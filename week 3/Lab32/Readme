Plan for data preparation, approaches and summary
Table contains 30 rows 

TransactionID	and ClientID are fine
BirthYear: 2 missing -> replace with mean
Amount: 1 outlier -> drop
Profession column is non numerical + 2 missing -> replace with modal
Risk column is non numerical, no missing values
Department: only one value -> drop
No duplicates
Inconsistent data in profession column (manager vs Manager, hr vs HR, etudient vs student, bdm vs BDM)

Part 4: Encode categorical data
Profession and Risk need to be encoded
